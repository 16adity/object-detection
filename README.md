# object-detection
This code utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model, ResNet-50, to recognize objects in images or through a webcam feed. It first preprocesses the input image frame, extracts features using ResNet-50, and decodes predictions into human-readable labels or text. 
Here's a suggested README.md content for your GitHub repository related to the animal detection code:

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/animal-detection.git](https://github.com/16adity/object-detection.git)
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Detection using Webcam

Run the following command to detect animals using your webcam:

```bash
python detection_using_camera.py
```

Press 'q' to exit the webcam feed.

### Detection using Image

To detect animals in a specific image, modify the `detection_using_image()` function in `detection_using_image.py` to specify the path to your image file, then run:

```bash
python detection_using_image.py
```
